# OpenADSBReceiver - Testplatform

OpenADSBReceiver is an open source project to build an ADS-B receiver that does not rely on the RaspberryPi and external SDR, but rather on an ADS-B receiver chip (https://www.gns-electronics.de/product/gns-5892r-low-power-low-cost-ads-b-modul/) and a low power microprocessor like the ESP32 or similar.

This GitHub project is to share designes for the first ADS-B receiver prototypes.
